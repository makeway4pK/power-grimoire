2 types of cells:
- note Cells
- code cells

#!markdown

note cells are interpreted as markdown text  
Code cells hold code and that can be run vell by cell or all cells at once.

#!markdown

Notebook has two states:
- Editing cell mode
- Not editing mode (Viewing mode maybe?)

#### **Editing mode**
  - Focused cell is editable, monospace font
  - Basically text boxes, editable content
  - [Syntax highlighting]()
  
#### **Not editing mode**
  - Can't edit content
  - But keyboard is freed up for managing cells
  - can navigate among cells with [arrow keys]()
  - select consecutives holding [Shift]()
  - delete focused cell by [double tapping D]()
  - New code cell above with [A]()
  - New code cell below with [B]()
  - Change cell type to note with [M]()
  - Change cell type to code with [Y]()  
  Custom:
  - Join selected cells with [Shift+J]()
  - Code cell below [Ctrl+Enter]()
  

#!pwsh

echo "This is a code cell"
echo "Shift+Enter		: Run 						##(usually Run + Focus next)"
echo "Ctrl+Enter  		: Stop edit, same as Esc 	##(usually Run + Stop edit)"
echo "Ctrl+Alt+Enter  	: Stop edit, same as Esc 	"
echo "Ctrl+Shift+Enter	: Run + Focus next, useful for controlled execution from the start"

echo "Alt+Enter   		: Run + new cell below"
echo "Alt+Shift+Enter	: Run + Stop edit 			##(usually nothing)"

#!markdown

Do I like it?  
pros:
- easy debug/testing new code
- easy to run/rerun parts of code
- overall an improvement over powershell for code
- always available variable watch
- note cells can be moved with [Alt+up/down]()
- note comments! [Ctrl+Q](), or I think its just the comment line keybind

cons:
- no folding for notes in markdown view
- checks inside checkboxes are almost invisible, I doubt settings or color theme tweaks can fix this
- paddings are huge and Markdown uses a big yet crowded font that's not even monospace,  
  must be fixable in settings.
- keyboard nav is fiddly when code output is involved
- not an advantage compared to plain text for note-keeping
- useful for everything except when actual scripts, in-built  
  variables and the runtime environment is involved, which is  
  most of what I'm gonna do next.  
<!-- - dunno how to change default kernel for the notebook after creation ðŸ˜­
  [fixed-easy]Found a setting from the command palette to set defualt lang and extension -->


gonna try taking notes with this for a while, maybe familiarity will fix it.

I think this notebook isn't useful for code research rn
but its handy for note-taking, preview and monospace in same editor
