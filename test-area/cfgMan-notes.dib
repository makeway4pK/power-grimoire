Q: set-variable scopes options? parent scope possible?

#!pwsh

sv -Visibility Public abc cdf
$varItem = (gv abc)

#!pwsh

$varItem.Attributes+'ascasc'

#!pwsh

$varItem.Options

#!pwsh

function setv([string] $str){
	sv -Visibility Public FnVar $str
}

#!pwsh

setv 'String1'
gv FnVar

#!markdown

- okay, sv-vis public doesn't let vars out of functions, as expected... but that can be a problem

#!markdown

dot scoping the setter function from another script file seems an easy but clunky solution, last option

#!pwsh

function setv([string] $str){
	sv -Visibility Script FnVar $str
}

#!pwsh

setv 'String2'

#!markdown

set-var is limited in its scope options but I see a way by handling vars using the obj returned by get-var

#!pwsh

$gvOut=gv
$gvOut.GetType()
$gvOut.Contains('$')

#!markdown

- it's an Array of variable objects

#!pwsh

$gvOut=gv -Scope Script
$gvOut.count
$gvOut=gv -Scope Local
$gvOut.count
$gvOut=gv -Scope Global
$gvOut.count
help gv

#!markdown

I think this notebook isn't useful for code research rn

#!markdown

- PSVariable objs store referenced values, i.e. shallow copies of variables that they represent(or point to)

#!markdown

- `sv -scope Script` allows to set vars from inside a function

#!pwsh

rv Tvar*
rv `@*
1..9|foreach{sv "Tvar$_" "TestValue: $_"}
# gv Tvar*
$liTvar=(gv Tvar*)|select -Property Name,Value
# rv $Tvars
rv Tvar*
rv `@*

$liTvar|sv
$Tvar5

#!pwsh

rv Tvar*
rv `@*
1..9|foreach{$liTvar=@{}}{
	$var=(sv "Tvar$_" "TestValue: $_" -PassThru)
	$liTvar[$var]=$var.Value
	}
# gv Tvar*
rv Tvar*
rv `@*

$liTvar|sv
# sv $liTvar
$Tvar5
# $Tvar5.GetType()

#!markdown

Current options for varaible setter:

- Dot scoping -------------------------------- [<going with this\>]()
  - `sv -scope script` allows setting variables from a function to the script scope
  - which will be the caller script's scope since cfgMan will called by dot-scoping
- pass values to caller
  - needs loop in caller code (pls no)
  - because set-variable can't handle collections/pipelined values

#### [Parsing]()

- `Select-string` is faster than `Get-content` for bigger files
  [Stack-Overflow: get-content high memory usage ](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38870089/ps-get-content-high-memory-usage-is-there-a-more-efficient-way-to-filter-a-file)
- ~~I might be able to parse varlists faster if added to the annotations that show up when using  
  ` help <cmdlet/script>`~~

#!markdown

Tested all three on a ~2MB text file out of which ~500KB were notes, fresh terminal (I hope nothing was cached(??))
![Alt text](Screenshot%202023-05-17%20182833.png)

- [Select-string (sls)]() is fastest among the three, no need for annotations

#!pwsh

"Get-Help      took "+(Measure-command {get-help .\helptest.ps1 -full}).milliseconds+"ms for notes"
"Get-Content   took "+(measure-command {(gc .\helptest.ps1) -match 'note'}).milliseconds+"ms for notes"
"Select-String took "+(measure-command {sls -path .\helptest.ps1 'code'}).milliseconds+"ms  for code"
"Select-String took "+(measure-command {sls -path .\helptest.ps1 'note'}).milliseconds+"ms  for notes"

#!markdown

Select-string has limitations: - can't retreive multiline pattern matches
(not without getting content into a string first) - can't get data by line numbers

On the other hand, get-content has a [-Raw]() option that gets content into a single string  
instead of an array of strings which makes it [FAST](), even faster than sls, have a look:

#!pwsh

"Get-Help      took "+(Measure-command {get-help .\helptest.ps1 -full}).milliseconds+"ms for notes"
"Get-Content   took "+(measure-command {(gc .\helptest.ps1) -match 'note'}).milliseconds+"ms for notes"
"Select-String took "+(measure-command {sls -path .\helptest.ps1 'code'}).milliseconds+"ms  for code"
"Select-String took "+(measure-command {sls -path .\helptest.ps1 'note'}).milliseconds+"ms  for notes"

"`nGet-Content-r took "+(measure-command {(gc .\helptest.ps1 -Raw) -match 'code'}).milliseconds+"ms for notes"

#!markdown

parser will capture everything from top of script to the first cfgman call,  
 replace cfgman with output varname for the var list and use iex to get the list of variable names.

- Thus, cfgman calls will need to:
  - be placed as close to the top as possible, before any sort of operations  
    like changing working dirs or running init methods
  - cfgman call must be contained in a single line, so if the list needs multiple lines, define the list in a var above the call and then use the var in the cfgman call.
- the captured param block will throw an error so dump the iex's error stream (and output stream as well?)  
  like so `iex $captured 2>&1>$null`

#!markdown

cfgMan's job is to set variables requested by the script when called with -get option

- -get option objective: set variables in varlist; 2 methods:
  - get script name and use matching cfgBox without checking varlist
    - need to confirm cfgBox is updated
      - if not updated, parse script and update before setting values
  - parse script to get varlist then set values
    - gc-raw script data, find cfgman call, iex and get varlist, set vars
- -collect option objective: get varlists from all scripts and make entries in cfgRoll + inform if any (new/old) vars are undefined.

#!markdown

#### [cfgBox Viability]()

- For cfgBox to be useful, detecting changes in script & var values in cfgRoll must be faster than parsing and setting variables that way
- detecting changes will be constant time while parsing will partly depend on script length and could be much faster if the script/varlist is small.
- So, next up is finding the script length at which they perform similarly...

#!markdown

for checking if cfgBox values are updated, I need to:

- check and maintain last modified times of:
  - cfgRoll
  - the script
  - cfgBox
    - cfgBox's modtime must be greater than cfgRoll's
- if changes are detected in the script, the new varlist needs to be checked against the old varlist from cfgBox for differences and cfgBox updated if any found.
- else if changes are detected only in cfgRoll, update cfgBox with varlist from cfgBox

#!markdown

Based on rough comparisons, It's worth using the cfgBox for files that are at least as big as Helptest.ps1(2.12MB):

#!pwsh

pushd ..
(measure-command{./test-area\cfgMan-test.ps1 -path ./test-area\helptest.ps1}).TotalMilliseconds
(measure-command{./test-area\cfgMan-test.ps1 -path ./test-area\helptest.ps1 -parse}).TotalMilliseconds
popd

#!markdown

But for small files:

#!pwsh

# $path ='./test-area\cfgMan-test.ps1'  # 2.12MB
$path = './stable/setgcc32.ps1'       # 6.81KB
# $path = './stable/wadb.ps1'           # 0.31KB
$n=1000

pushd ..
$boxTime=0
$parseTime=0
1..$n|%{
$boxTime+=(measure-command{./test-area/cfgMan-test.ps1 -path $path}).TotalMilliseconds
$parseTime+=(measure-command{./test-area/cfgMan-test.ps1 -path $path -parse}).TotalMilliseconds
}
"box check avg: "+$boxTime/$n
"parser avg:    "+$parseTime/$n
"file size:     "+[int]((gi $path).Length*100/1KB)/100+" KB"
popd

#!markdown

Looks like they break even at around [7KB]() on my machine  
Actually no, the parser is [only 3-5%]() better than the box check if not worse, even for a script as small as 0.31KB (setgcc32). On the other hand the parser can be over 8 times slower than the box check for a very big script(70ms to 9ms, both avg times for helptest.ps1)
So in [Conclusion](), cfgBox is indeed useful and should be implemented to speedup runtime var fetches
